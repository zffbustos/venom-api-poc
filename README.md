- Reset the Personal Access Token, then Copy it.

- Paste this token in the "zfapi-personal-token" variable in the tests

## Test execution example

To run one case using, run the script from the root directory:

`% ./run_test {path_to_your_test}`

For example:

`% ./run_test tests/login/get-request-zfdash-login.venom.yml`

The console will output several results, and you can find them in the directory `outputs`. In this example, the test results will be in:
