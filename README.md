# venom-api-poc

This project is a Proof of concept regarding the Venom testing for the QA team. It contains a basic testing environment that have multiple directories following the main flows used in the Cypress ZF Dashboard testing.

## Venom Installation

To install Venom, you have to run the script `Ã¬nstall_venom.sh`. This scripts will clone the venom repository from `riskive/venom` into your local directory. Then will compile its source code and install it into your machine.
Please notice this process requires you to provide your sudo credentials when installing venom.

To verify Venom has been installed successfully, try this command:

`% venom v`

## Test configuration

TBD (rephrase this)

You run the tests, you need the credentials for the ZF Dashboard account you're currently using.

- Go to Settings -> Data Connectors -> API Data Feeds tab -> API Tokens

- Reset the Personal Access Token, then Copy it.

- Paste this token in the "zfapi-personal-token" variable in the tests

## Test execution example

To run one case using, run the script from the root directory:

`% ./run_test {path_to_your_test}`

For example:

`% ./run_test tests/login/get-request-zfdash-login.venom.yml`

The console will output several results, and you can find them in the directory `outputs`. In this example, the test results will be in:

`outputs/tests/login/get-request-zfdash-login.venom.yml.061223_174002`

## Test Lists

To run multiple tests, there is a directory called `test-lists` which contains files with extension `.list`. These files are lists of `.yml` test cases. These files contain the lists of cases you need to run.

If you want to run a test list, make sure your file has the `.list` extension and it contains the tests you need to run. Once you're ready, you can call the `run_test.sh` script just like any single test case.

`% ./run_test {path_to_your_tests}.list`

If the list of cases does not end with the `.list` extension, Venom will error out.

## Variables

According to the official documentation, there are multiple ways to use variables in the test files. For the purposes of this project, the flag `--var-from-file` will be used.

There is a directory called `variables` which contains files related to the test environment where the tests will be run. These variables have a free notation, however they will follow these rules:

- If the variable is used only in one test, it will have the name of that test followed by the variable name.
- If the variable is used in multiple tests, it will have a representative name that will be used among all the test cases.

## Docker

Venom has a good integration with Docker, that's why in this project we include a small `Hello World` example to prove the capabilities of Venom by using it to make calls to a `http` server within a Docker image.

There is a directory called `images` which contains a Smocker image where you can create a hello world image. The image only contains the Smocker server, and the image creation is out of the scope of this project. You can find more information about Smocker in the References section.
